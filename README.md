# Self-Driving-Car-Simulation
Inoduction:
• An autonomous car is a vehicle capable of sensing its environment and operating without human involvement. 
• A human passenger is not required to take control of the vehicle at any time, nor is a human passenger required to be present in the vehicle at all. 
• An autonomous car can go anywhere a traditional car goes and do everything that an experienced human driver does.


The important implementations of this project are as follows:
•	Utilized machine learning concepts like Behavioral Cloning, Deep Neural Networks, Feature Extraction with Convolutional Neural Networks as well as Continuous Regression to simulate autonomous driving. 
•	In the training mode, car was driven manually to record the driving behavior. Used the recorded images to train the machine learning model. In the autonomous mode, tested machine learning model to see how well the model can drive the car without dropping off the road. Trained 2,52,219 parameters for achieving successful implementation.
